                Anime (ah-NIH-may) is a term for Japanese animation.
                Anime often covers more serious topics than the typical cartoon.
                In America, cartoons are considered a form of entertainment meant for children.
                In Japan, people of all ages watch anime.
                Most shows and movies are centered for kids, adolescents, or young adults, but there are also many anime
                that are made for the older crowd, even businessmen.
                There are many genres in anime with basic categories like comedy, romance, action, and drama.
                There are also anime with content meant specifically for boys (shounen), girls (shoujo), and
                businessmen.

        What is anime?

    </h2>
    <p>
        Anime (ah-NIH-may) is a term for Japanese animation. Anime often covers more serious topics than the typical
        cartoon. In America, cartoons are considered a form of entertainment meant for children. In Japan, people of all
        ages watch anime. Most shows and movies are centered for kids, adolescents, or young adults, but there are also
        many anime that are made for the older crowd, even businessmen. There are many genres in anime with basic
        categories like comedy, romance, action, and drama. There are also anime with content meant specifically for
        boys (shounen), girls (shoujo), and businessmen.
    </p>

        Many people in the U.S. have heard of cartoons like Sailor Moon, Dragonball Z, Voltron, Gundam Wing, Speed
        Racer, Digimon, and Pokemon; Famous cartoons that have bizarre character designs: female characters with
        beautiful round eyes, hair that is incredibly big, and gorgeous figure and physique. Male characters would
        usually have enormously huge muscles (as seen in Dragonball Z and GT), powerful bodies and maybe, on occasion,
        have gigantic robots as seen in cartoons like Robotech and Gundam Wing.
        Japanese animation, also known as anime (pronounced "ani-may"), is a popular form of animation in Japan which is
        quickly spreading in the U.S. The major difference between anime and American cartoons is that unlike American
        cartoons, which are only watched by children, anime is popular among the Japanese adults and is watched by
        millions. The audience is not merely directed to children but to teens and adults as well. The same applies to
        Japanese comics known as manga.
        In order to understand anime and its invasion into the US, a look into its history would be most appropriate.
        The best place to start is around World War II, since that was the time when the anime and manga (Japanese
        comics) industry evolved significantly.
        During World War II the entire Japanese nation was mobilized. The people were forced to conform to the
        government's demands or pay the ultimate price. According to Frederik Schodt's book, Manga Manga: The World of
        Japanese Comics, those who failed to cooperate were punished by "preventive detention, bans on writing, and
        social ostracism, while those who recanted were rewarded with rehabilitation programs and support from the
        community...artists who had spent most of their lives criticizing the government did an about-face and offered
        wholehearted support to the militarists"
        Around 1940, many organizations for artists and cartoonists were formed. Among them were the New Cartoonists
        Association of Japan (Shin Nippon Mangaka Kyokai) and the New Cartoonists Faction Group (Shin Mangaha Shudan).
        During that time, the government used the few remaining cartoonists, who were not banned from working or who
        were not in the army, to influence the people through their artwork by creating comic strips filled with
        propaganda to use against the nation's enemies.

        In the U.S. an artist who went by the name of Walt Disney was struggling as a cartoonist. Long before Mickey
        Mouse, he started out with Alice's Wonderland and Oswald the Lucky Rabbit in the 1920s. Then on November 16,
        1928, Mickey Mouse was born and became an instant hit in the US. Disney decided to work on other projects and
        started on an animated feature film called Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The film, released in 1937, was a
        hit. Things went smoothly for the Disney Studio until World War II came along. Nevertheless, Disney continued to
        work and released Pinocchio and Fantasia in 1940. Although the two were technical masterpieces, the studio was
        losing a great deal of money since they were losing the foreign market due to the war. Disney then released
        Dumbo,on a very limited budget, in 1941 and Bambi in 1942. As a result of releasing many expensive and costly
        films during the war, Disney began to diminish in influence.
        During the war, Walt Disney Studios released two more films Saludos Amigos and The Three Caballeros in South
        America. Throughout the war, Disney concentrated on making propaganda and training films for the military. After
        the war, Disney Studios struggled to make it back to top as they released several "package" films containing
        groups of short cartoons packaged together. Among these films were Make Mine Music and Melody Time. By 1950,
        Disney Studios regained success with the live action film, Treasure Island, and the animated feature,
        Cinderella.
        With all the success, Walt Disney felt there was still something he had not yet accomplished. It was not until
        he found his intriguing attraction to amusement parks that pushed him to build his own theme park, one that
        children, parent, and people of all ages could enjoy. Thus after many years of planning, construction, and
        development, Disneyland was built in 1955. It became a monumental park that brought visitors from around the
        world.
        Though Disneyland kept Disney rather busy, he, along with his studio and team, continued releasing quality
        entertainment. Disney released 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, The Shaggy Dog, the popular TV series Zorro, and
        Mary Poppins. Unfortunately, the 1960s brought the end of an era: in December 15, 1966 Walt Disney died.
        However, the Walt Disney Studios managed to survive under the plans that Walt left behind and under the guidance
        of his brother Roy Disney. Disney remained under Roy's leadership with further releases of The Jungle Book in
        1967, The Love Bug in 1969, and The Aristocrats in 1970. By 1971 Roy Disney died and for the next decade, the
        company was led by a team who was originally trained by the Disney brothers.
